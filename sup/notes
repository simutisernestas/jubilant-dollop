DECENTRALIZED COLLABORATIVE LOCALIZATION USING ULTRA-WIDEBAND RANGING
This last one has algorithm in pseudo code, could start right there to simulate
Also matlab implementation of it:

The goal of the special course is to investigate and develop a method for RF-based distributed localization in multi-robot systems. 

1. Investigate state-of-the-art methods for RF-based distributed localization in multi-robot systems.
2. Develop a process model and a sensor model for robots equipped with RF-based range sensor(s) as well as standard sensors (IMU, altimeter, compass, etc.). 
3. Develop a distributed localization method using the above-mentioned process and sensor model. Gather simulated data and apply the developed method. 
4. Gather experimental data and apply the developed method on it offline.
5. Analyze the developed method's performance to alternative localization methods, e.g., GPS or optical tracking. 
6. Optionally implement the method on hardware and test it online in a real-life scenario.

Deliverable: Technical report in the form of a double column 6-page IEEE paper, documented code repository, and experimental data.
